        <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Objective:</h3>
        <p class="py-4">The goal of Battleship is to sink all of your opponent's ships before they sink yours.</p>
        
        <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Setup:</h3>
        <ul class="py-4">
            <li><strong>Game Boards:</strong> Each player has a 10x10 grid to place their ships and track opponent guesses.</li>
            <li><strong>Ships:</strong> Players have 5 ships of varying lengths:
            <br>
            &nbsp;
                <ul>
                    <li>- Carrier (5 spaces)</li>
                    <li>- Battleship (4 spaces)</li>
                    <li>- Destroyer (3 spaces)</li>
                    <li>- Submarine (3 spaces)</li>
                    <li>- Patrol Boat (2 spaces)</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li><strong>Placement:</strong> Clicking ship icons before starting the game will rotate them horizontally or vertically. When ready, the player can drag-and-drop ships onto the grid (as long as they don't overlap with other ships or extend beyond the grid).</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Gameplay:</h3>
        <ul class="py-4">
            <li>The player can begin their first turn â€” click on a cell to attack.</li>
            <br>
            <li>The computer board will indicate if the coordinate is a "hit" (red dot), "miss" (white dot), or "sunk" (sunken ship icon reveals)</li>
            <br>
            <li>Your grid will also be marked with the same indicators as the computer attacks your board throughout the game.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Winning the Game:</h3>
        <p class="py-4">The first player to sink all of their opponent's ships wins the game!</p>

        <h3 class="font-bold text-lg">Tips:</h3>
        <ul class="py-4">
            <li>Use a strategy to avoid random guessing.</li>
            <li>Track hits to identify ship placements more efficiently.</li>
            <li>Don't cluster your ships together to reduce vulnerability.</li>
        </ul>
